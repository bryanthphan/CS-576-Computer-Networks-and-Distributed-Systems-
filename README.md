Program #1: 
In your IDE (I used eclipse), you must create two separate files one named “Client”, the other “Server.” 
The code in the "Program 1" folder will have notes detailing the functions within the two files. 
In order to run this program, you first run the Server file, and then afterwards run the Client file. 
A command prompt should pop up. If you enter a message that is less than 256 characters, such as “Hello World", you should expect “Ifmmp!Xpsme” as your output. 
If you enter a message that is more than 256 characters, an error message will pop up that says, “Sorry, this text has more than 256 characters" and asks you to “Please try again:.” 
This error message will continue to appear if the user enters a message that is more than 256 characters and will stop when a message less than 256 characters appears.
